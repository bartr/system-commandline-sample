# System.CommandLine Sample App

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Overview

This is a C# sample of using `System.CommandLine` to build a CLI application with commands and sub-commands

We use `extensions` to build and add the commands to the `RootCommand` then System.CommandLine handles everything for us

System.CommandLine supports type ahead which we plan to enable in the future (we love PRs!)

Start exploring in `Program.cs` - we added explanations in the code comments
